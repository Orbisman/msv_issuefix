# Schmit: SCHema In Transformation

Schmit is an [XSLT extension](https://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/extensions.html) that allows you to access schema annotation information from within the stylesheet. This functionality can be used to write more generic stylesheet that isn't tied to any particular XML vocabulary. The current release works for Apache Xalan.
