  XSDLib,  Sun's  implementation of W3C's XML Schema Part 2, is
  intended for use by application that incorporates XML Schema
  Part 2.</P>
<P>This preview version implements the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/PR-xmlschema-2-20010316/">proposed
recommendation version</A> of W3C XML Schema Part 2 Datatype. Being a
proposed recommendation&nbsp;means it is subject to change. In fact,
many important changes were made after the October 24, 2000 edition
and many changes may be made before it becomes a recommendation. So
developers should be forewarned about possible future changes,
including (but of course not limited to),</P>

<H1>Known Limitations</H1>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">Types "float" and
	"double": the spec says a lexical value must be mapped to
	the closest value in the value space. However,  XSDLib cannot accept
	values that are larger than the maximum value for that type or
	smaller than the minimum value for that type. This should not be a
	problem for most users.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">"ID", "IDREF",
	and "IDREFS" types are not implemented. Although
	uniqueness constraints are removed from part 2, these types are
	still intended to be used with uniqueness constraints. These
	constraints are so special that it is impossible to provide a
	generic implementation. <CODE>com.sun.tranquilo.datatype.DataTypeFactory</CODE>
	does not recognize these three types.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">"NOTATION" type is not
	implemented. <CODE>com.sun.tranquilo.datatype.DataTypeFactory</CODE>
	does not recognize this type. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">"length", "minLength",
	and "maxLength" facets are effectively limited to the
	value 2147483647. Values above this limit&nbsp;are recognized, but
	will be treated as this limit. Items larger than this limit will not
	be validated correctly. This limitation has no practical impact. 
	</P>
	<LI>"anyURI" (formerly "uriReference")&nbsp;is made to 
  accept several IP v6 addresses like "::192.168.0.1", which are not accepted by 
  the original BNF specified in RFC 2373. This modification should be considered 
  as a "bug fix". Although the BNF&nbsp;specified in&nbsp;RFC 2373 has several 
  other problems, those are not fixed. For example, the current release accepts 
  "1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:9", which is not a valid IP v6 address.
  
	<LI><P STYLE="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">"language" type is
	implemented in accordance with RFC 1766, and language identifiers
	are treated in a case-insensitive way. XML Schema Part 2 says that
	the lexical space of the          language type will be as defined
	in XML1.0 Recommendation 2nd edition, but that production&nbsp;was
	thrown away&nbsp;in the 2nd edition. Furthermore, the derivation
	shown in XML Schema Part 2 does not correctly implement the
	definition given in RFC 1766. So apparently there is a problem in
	the definition of the language type. However, by making "language"
	case-insensitive, it is no longer a derived type of "token"
	type.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">Regarding "base64Binary"
	type, RFC 2045 states that "any characters outside of the
	base64 alphabet are to be ignored in base64-encoded data." This
	makes "validation" of base64Binary meaningless. For
	example, &lt;picture&gt;))))&lt;/picture&gt; is considered as valid
	base64Binary. Developers&nbsp;should keep this in mind.</P>
	<LI><P>minInclusive,maxInclusive, minExclusive, and maxExclusive facets&nbsp;of date/time related types
	do not work properly. XML Schema Part 2 is broken as regards the
	order relation of these types. This also affects the behavior of
	"enumeration" facet (since equality is a part&nbsp;of
	order-relation.)&nbsp;See Kawaguchi's comments to
