<P>The Sun XML Schema Part 2 Java Implemantation (XSDLib) is 
an implementation of W3C XML Schema Part 2, intended for use by application 
developers as their building block.</P>
<P>This preview version implements 31st,Jan,2001 version of the candidate 
recommendation, which is only available to W3C members. As its date suggests, 
this version is newer than publicly available <A 
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-xmlschema-2-20001024/">24th,Oct,2000 
edition</A>.</P>
<P>W3C XML Schema Part 2 is still a candidate recommendation, which means it is subject to change. In fact, many 
important changes are made from 24th,Oct,2000 edition and many changes are still 
likely to be made before it becomes a recommendation. So developers should be warned 
for possible future changes including (but of course not limited 
to)</P>

<H1>Known Limitations</H1>
<OL>
  <LI>
  <DIV>For "float" and "double" types. The spec says a lexical value must be 
  mapped to the closest value in the value space, but XSDLib cannot accept 
  values which are bigger than maximum value of that type or smaller than 
  minimum value of that type.</DIV>
  <LI>
  "duration" facet and "period" facet are not 
  implemented because they are removed.
  <LI>
  <DIV>"binary" type and "encoding" facet are not implemented because they are 
  removed. Instead, "base64Binary" type and "hexBinary" types are 
  implemented.</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV>"ID", "IDREF", and "IDREFS" types are not implemented. These types are so special 
  that it is impossible to provide a generic implementation. 
  <code>com.sun.tranquilo.datatype.DataTypeFactory</code> does not 
  recognize these three types.</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV>"CDATA" type is implemented as "normalizedString" type, again because it 
  is renamed as such.</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV>"NOTATION" type is not implemented.
  <code>com.sun.tranquilo.datatype.DataTypeFactory</code> does not 
  recognize this type 
  name. </DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV>"timeInstant" type is implemented as "dateTime" 
  type.</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV>"timeDuration" type is implemented as "duration" type.</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV>"timePeriod" type is not implemented because it is removed.</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV>"century" type is not implemented because it is removed.</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV>"month" type is implemented as "yearMonth" type.</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV>"recurringDate" type is implemented as "monthDay" type.</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV>"recurringDay" type is implemented as "day" type.</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV>"length", "minLength", and "maxLength" facet is effectively limited upto 
  2147483647. Values above this limit&nbsp;are recognized, but will be treated 
  as this limit. Items longer than this limit will not be validated 
  correctly.</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV>Implementation of "precision" and "scale" should be considered as 
  incomplete. The spec is not clear enough.</DIV></LI></OL></BODY></HTML>
