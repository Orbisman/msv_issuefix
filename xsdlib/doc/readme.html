<P>The Sun XML Schema Part 2 Java Implemantation (XSDLib) is 
an implementation of W3C XML Schema Part 2, intended for use by application 
developers as their building block.</P>
<P>This preview version implements <A 
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/PR-xmlschema-2-20010316/">proposed 
recommendation version</A> of the candidate recommendation. Being a proposed 
recommendation&nbsp;means it is subject to change. In fact, many important 
changes are made from 24th,Oct,2000 edition and many changes are&nbsp;going to 
be made before it becomes a recommendation. So developers should be warned 
for possible future changes including (but of course not limited to)</P>

<H1>Known Limitations</H1>
<OL>
  <LI>
  <DIV>For "float" and "double" types. The spec says a 
  lexical value must be mapped to the closest value in the value space, but XSDLib 
  cannot accept values which are bigger than maximum value of that type or 
  smaller than minimum value of that type. However this shouldn't be a problem 
  for the most of users.</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV>"ID", "IDREF", and "IDREFS" types are not 
  implemented. Although uniqueness constraints are removed from part 2, these 
  types are still intended to be used with uniqueness constraints. These constraints are so special 
  that it is impossible to provide a generic implementation. 
  <code>com.sun.tranquilo.datatype.DataTypeFactory</code> does not 
  recognize these three types.</DIV>
  <LI>"NOTATION" type is not implemented.
  <code>com.sun.tranquilo.datatype.DataTypeFactory</code> does 
  not recognize this type name. 
  <LI>
  "length", "minLength", and "maxLength" facet is 
  effectively limited upto 2147483647. Values above this limit&nbsp;are 
  recognized, but will be treated as this limit. Items longer than this limit 
  will not be validated correctly. Author believes that this limitation has no 
  practical impact.
  <LI>
  <DIV>Implementation of "totalDigits" and "fractionDigits" should be considered as 
  incomplete. The spec is not clear enough.</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV>"anyURI" (former "uriReference")&nbsp;is made to accept IP v6 
  addresses like "::192.168.0.1", which is not accepted by the original BNF 
  specified in RFC 2373. This modification should be considered as a "bug fix". Although, BNF&nbsp;specified in&nbsp;RFC 2373 has 
  several other problems, those are not fixed. For example, the current release 
  accepts "1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:9", which is not a valid IP v6 
address.</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV>"language" type is implemented in accordance with RFC 
  1766, and language identifiers are treated in case-insensitive way. XML Schema 
  Part 2 says that the lexical space of language type will be as defined in XML1.0 Recommendation 2nd edition, but that production&nbsp;was thrown away&nbsp;in 
  the 2nd edition. Even worse, the derivation shown in XML Schema Part 
  2 does not correctly implement the definition given in RFC 1766. So apparently 
  there is a problem in the definition of "language" type. However, by making 
  "language" case-insensitive, it is no longer a derived type of "token" 
  type.</DIV></LI></OL></BODY></HTML>
