----------------------------------------------

- RELAX NG DTD compatibility spec is supported.

  when the "strict schema check" switch is turned on.
  For details of the limitation, see commandline.html

  For details, look at JAXPmasquerading.html


- W3C XML Schema support is improved

  Several bugs (handling of attribute wildcards, etc) are fixed.


- "strict" schema check is implemented

  Schema parser now has a switch to perform extra schema checks,
  at the expense of consuming more time to parse a schema.
  Command line tool is updated to accept the "-strict" option
  for this purpose.

  TypedStringExp is splitted into DataExp and ValueExp.


- more examples are added
