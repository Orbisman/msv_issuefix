RELAXNGReader.Compatibility.Annotation.ChildElement = \
	the annotation element cannot have any child element.

RELAXNGReader.Compatibility.Annotation.InvalidAttribute = \
	the annotation element cannot have the "{0}" attribute.

RELAXNGReader.Compatibility.Annotation.Misplaced = \
	the annotation element cannot be written after the "{0}" element.

RELAXNGReader.Compatibility.ID.MalplacedIDType = \
	The "{0}" type has {1} semantics and therefore it must be placed \
	directly under an attribute pattern.

RELAXNGReader.Compatibility.ID.IDTypeWithNonSimpleAttName = \
	The "{0}" type has {1} semantics and therefore its parent attribute pattern \
	must have a simple name.

RELAXNGReader.Compatibility.ID.IDTypeWithNonSimpleElementName = \
	The "{0}" type has {1} semantics and therefore the enclosing element pattern \
	must have a simple name.

RELAXNGReader.Compatibility.ID.Competing = \
	The "{0}" type has {1} semantics but a competing attribute of another element \
	doesn't have the same type.

RELAXNGReader.Compatibility.ID.Competing2 = \
	The "{1}" type of the "{0}" attribute has ID semantics but a competing attribute \
	doesn't have the same type.
