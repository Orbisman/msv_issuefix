(TREX)  modified to accept old "http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema"
        namespace with a warning.
(both)  Better error diagnosis gets produced when the user forgot to
        declare namespace URI or declared a wrong namespace.

2000/03/20 release
------------------

(RELAX) When obsoleted type names like "uriReference" is used, Tranquilo
        now reports a warning but pretend as if it saw a correct type.
(both)  "Panic mode" is implemented: Tranquilo suppress excessive
        error messages.
(dt)    Updated datatype library to catch up with PR version of XML Schema.
(both)  Fixed a bug that makes validation a little bit slower
        and that sometimes interferes with type-assignment.
(both)  Added "optimistic" type-assignment mechanism for Verifier.
        This is the equivalent of "RELAXEffortlessHandler" which
        is implemented in "RELAX Verifier for Java" by Swift,Inc.
        This mechanism is "optimistic" in the sense that Verifier
        will report type as long as it can decide it; once if Verifier
        fails to decide type, it bails out (verification will be continued).
(both)	Implemented VerifierFilter that acts as XMLFilter.
(both)  Fixed bugs in integer-derived types and uriReference type.
(RELAX) Supports "Java API for RELAX Verifier".
(both)  XML parser can now be choosed from Xerces or Crimson,
        by using a command line switch.
(both)  Performance optimization
(RELAX) Reader now detects ID/IDREF abuse, which is prohibited by
        the formal specification of RELAX.
(RELAX) ID/IDREF types are implemented
(RELAX) Reader signals an error when two <attribute> declarations have the
        same target attribute name.
(both)  Reader signals an error when namespace-unaware ParserFactory is given.

2000/03/09 release
------------------

(both)  done a lot of optimization that makes validation faster
(RELAX) support <anyOtherElement>.
(RELAX) add check for those exported hedgeRules which directly or indirectly
        refer labels of the other namespaces.
(both)  better error recovery for unexpected character literals.
(RELAX) detects an error when unexported elementRules/hedgeRules are
        referenced from the other namespaces.
(RELAX) implements RELAX semantics of ignoring undeclared attributes.
